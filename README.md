# UtsargBot

A bot made is Discord.py, originally used for own purposes I wanted to release because...
why not.

How to use:

1: In Main.py scroll to the bottom and where it says "add token here" put your discord bots token
2: Make sure you have python and all the libs installed, You can find a list at the bottom of this
3: Run the main.py file
4: Invite your bot to a discord server
5: run .help (default prefix is "." but it can be changed manually) I will be chaning this in a future update where anybody with the right perms can change it
6: If it does run right then the bot now works, if you want to you can host it for free (i have provided the files) to self-host it on repl.it

# Notes

If the bot isnt working check the following:
1: you have all the libs and stuff downloaded (you can find it at the bottom of this page)
2: Make sure you ran Main.py and not anything else
3: there are more I forgot rn but I can 100% help you if you contact me on discord (Utsarg#0486)
